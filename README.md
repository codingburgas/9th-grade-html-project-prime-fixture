## 🔍 About the Project <a name="about"></a>

**Prime Fixture** is a firefighter-oriented software solution developed as a school project, built to simulate a professional-grade emergency management platform. It is designed with the intention of optimizing core firefighting operations such as personnel tracking, shift scheduling, and resource monitoring.

With a streamlined interface and a modular architecture, Prime Fixture enables intuitive navigation through complex data — allowing users to manage tasks, monitor team readiness, and visualize operational logistics in real time. Though built in an academic setting, the system mirrors real-world emergency response needs and aims to represent how digital tools can enhance safety, speed, and coordination in firefighting environments.
